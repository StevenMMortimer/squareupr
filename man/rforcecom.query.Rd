\usage{
rforcecom.query(session, soqlQuery, queryAll = FALSE)
}
\arguments{
\item{session}{\code{list}; a list containing "sessionID", "instanceURL", and "
apiVersion" as returned by \code{RForcecom::rforcecom.login()}. This argument is
ignored in all backward compatible calls because the authorization credentials 
are stored in an environment internal to the salesforcer package, so it is no longer 
necessary to pass the session in each function call.}

\item{soqlQuery}{character; a string defining a SOQL query (e.g. "SELECT Id, Name FROM Account")}

\item{queryAll}{logical; indicating if the query recordset should include 
deleted and archived records (available only when querying Task and Event records)}
}
\value{
Result dataset.
